**EmotiCue** is not just a website but more like a friend to whom you go when you want to share your feelings and feel at peace. It also recommends you movies,songs and books according to your mood(the perfect best firend isn't it?).It eliminates all the hardwork one has to do in order to find the perfect movie to binge watch or the perfect song to listen on loop.

##  Inspiration

We all struggle to pick the right movie, book, or song that truly fits our mood. EmotiCue bridges that gap using emotional intelligence and natural language understanding, making content discovery deeply personal and effortless.
